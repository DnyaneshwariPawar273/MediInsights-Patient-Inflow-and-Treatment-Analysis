# MediInsights: Patient Inflow & Treatment Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital patient inflow, departmental performance, doctor workload, and treatment cost distribution using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The solution transforms raw patient-level data into meaningful insights to support hospital management in monitoring operational efficiency and financial performance.

🚨 Problem Statement

The hospital lacked a centralized analytics system to monitor patient admissions, evaluate department performance, and analyze treatment cost trends.

Without structured analysis:

- Patient admission trends were unclear

- Inpatient and outpatient distribution was not properly monitored

- Treatment cost inconsistencies were not validated

- Department and doctor performance could not be evaluated effectively

An interactive dashboard solution was required to support data-driven healthcare management.
